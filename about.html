            <img class="about-band-image" src="Images/Imagine Dragons.jpg">
            <p>Over the last half-decade, Imagine Dragons have emerged as one of the biggest and most compelling rock bands in the
            world. Within a year of its June 2017 release, their third studio album EVOLVE went double-platinum, yielding three
            back-to-back #1 singles: “Believer,” “Thunder,” and “Whatever It Takes.” In the midst of their Evolve World Tour—a 116
            date trek that sold over 1.7 million tickets worldwide—the multi-platinum, Grammy Award-winning band began working on
            their follow-up, and ended up creating their most dynamic work to date.</p>
                   
            <p>Conceived as a sister album to Evolve, Origins continues its predecessors sonic explorations while honoring Imagine
            Dragons alt-rock heritage. “Its about seeking new ground but also appreciating your roots,” says lead vocalist Dan
            Reynolds, whose bandmates include guitarist Wayne Sermon, bassist Ben McKee, and drummer Daniel Platzman. “When we
            create, we create with no boundaries, no rules. We find it thrilling to make music that feels different and new to us.”.</p>


            <p>Self-identifying as “genreless,” Imagine Dragons joined forces with producers like Joel Little (Lorde, Khalid), Mattman
            & Robin (Selena Gomez, Carly Rae Jepsen), and John Hill (Florence + the Machine, Phantogram) to sculpt the kaleidoscopic
            and kinetically charged sound of Origins. With the band artfully blending rock, hip-hop, pop, and folk, the album is
            etched in inventive textures that never distract from an essential element of Imagine Dragons: lyrics that speak to a
            sometimes-painful self-awareness, but ultimately uplift and inspire.</p>

            <p>On Origins’ powerhouse lead single “Natural”—a track that topped the Alternative Songs for five straight weeks, and
            broke the all-time spin record on the alternative radio chart with over 4K spins in a single week—Imagine Dragons offer
            a meditation on self-discovery, sharing the message that “when you truly learn to love yourself, judging eyes and
            hateful words become meaningless,” as Reynolds puts it. With its title nodding to Charles Darwin’s On the Origin of
            Species and Imagine Dragons’ fascination with evolutionary biology, Origins also examines how technological advancement
            has altered the human experience. Featured as the end-credit song in the Walt Disney Animation Studios movie Ralph
            Breaks the Internet, the fantastically fast-paced “Zero” looks at isolation in the social media age but slyly unfolds as
            an anthem of self-acceptance. Meanwhile, the fuzzed-out and frenetic “Digital” captures a certain existential
            frustration, yet hints at Reynolds’s hope for greater open-heartedness in younger generations.</p>
