            Wayne Sermon, bassist Ben McKee and drummer Daniel Platzman. The band first gained exposure with the release of their
            single "It's Time", followed by their award-winning debut studio album Night Visions (2012), which resulted in the
            chart-topping singles "Radioactive" and "Demons". Rolling Stone named "Radioactive", which held the record for most
